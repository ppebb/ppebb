## hi. im pollen, or [ppeb](https://ppeb.me).

`pollen__#4062` ([server](https://discord.gg/EB6yPZj)) // `@ppeb:matrix.org` // [ppeb@ppeb.me](mailto:ppeb@ppeb.me)

programmer and arch linux user. neovim and dwm ricer. general programming ability in many languages: c#, javascript, typescript, lua(?), bash, python, and more soon. terraria modder. i like open source.

## projects
a few small, and mostly dead projects. i have a desire to revive most of them but no time or motivation.
* [tconfigwrapper](https://github.com/pollen00/tConfigWrapper), loads tconfig mods in tmodloader. pending rewrite for 1.4 and because the code isnt great.
* [rustcord](https://github.com/pollen00/rustcord), fltk discord client written in rust. never really got off of the ground. would love to revisit.
* [haste-nvim](https://github.com/pollen00/haste-nvim), neovim plugin to upload the current buffer to a haste instance. shouldn't need any more updates as long as there's no bugs.
* [dwm fork](https://github.com/pollen00/dwm), heavily patched fork of dwm. will be continuing to rice and should eventually contiain things outside of dwm (dmenu, eww, maybe more). somewhat due to chadwm not being a good fit for me.
* [multtable](https://github.com/pollen00/multtable), multiplication tables in various languages. created to make fun of my brother.
* [tml setup tool](https://github.com/pollen00/tModLoader/tree/linussetup/setup), rewrite of the exiting tmodloader setup tool for crossplatform cli. unfinished, should be worked on soon.

nothing here is too impressive sadly.
